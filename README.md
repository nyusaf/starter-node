## How To Run

This project uses Node, Express, and Gulp to run a small webserver. For best results you may want to have these installed before cloning this repo:

+ [Node](https://nodejs.org)
+ [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
+ [Bower](http://bower.io)
+ [Bower Installer](https://github.com/blittle/bower-installer)

Once you have the repo cloned, make sure you install the dependencies

```shell
  > npm install -d # for server dependencies
  > bower install # for client dependencies
```

Once the dependencies have installed, you can run in "developement mode" with

`npm run dev`

You can then view the app in a browser using the URL

`http://localhost:9999`
